# Predicting Perth House Prices

## Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis for predicting property prices in the Perth area, Western Australia. 
The primary goal is to develop a predictive model that provides estimates for property prices based on various influential factors. 
The insights from this project aim to facilitate informed decision-making in property investment and sales within the region.

## Problem Statements

### Focused Approach
- Identify factors influencing property prices in Perth.
- Assess the impact of property development years and sale years on prices.
- Determine the significance of property location on pricing.

## Data Preparation and Preprocessing

### Data Identification
- Identifying relevant attributes like bedrooms, bathrooms, land area, built year, distance to city center, nearest station, and school proximity.

### Preprocessing
- Handling missing values and converting data types as necessary.
- Conducting descriptive statistics for relevant property attributes.
- Identifying and handling outliers in the dataset.

## Statistical and Machine Learning Analysis

### Inferential Statistics
- Correlation tests to determine relationships between property attributes and prices.
- Calculating correlations to measure attribute-property relationships.

### Machine Learning Application
- Application of supervised machine learning regression methods for predicting property prices.
- Model evaluation and inference testing for accuracy assessment.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

### Influential Factors
- Suburb, nearest station, nearest school, bedrooms, and land area exhibit significant correlations with property prices.
- Insights on property development and recent sale years showed negligible impacts on property pricing.

### Location Significance
- Property location, segmented into exclusive and affordable areas, significantly affects pricing.
- Distance from the city center plays a pivotal role in property pricing variations.

## Results Summary

### Best-Performing Model
- Utilizing KNN Regressor with specific independent variables yielded the most optimal model performance based on R^2 score.
